For example when running rbrt from rspec without loading eg Rails it should be required in spec helper and in case you run rbrt in Rails application rbrt_setup.rb should be required in initializers.

   $ cp \`bundle show rbrt\`\lib\rbrt_setup.rb.move_to_project_main_directory rbrt_setup.rb

## Usage

This is a collection of classes to help write business logic, mainly handling domain object associations like has_many, has_one and role. It will also keep state for new/destroyed objects/associations that can later be read by persistance object to generate proper SQL writes. Program can depend on query methods for DB reads(queries.post_with_comments(post_id: post_id)) and persistance object (persistance.add(post); persistance.add(comments); persistance.persist) for DB writes.
