# Rbrt

## Descriprion

This is a business logic framework for ruby. It is meant as help for keeping tract of what is the state of domain objects and associations in memory. When time comes you can add domain objects to persistance object which will generate proper SQL writes.

Business logic can depend on query methods for DB reads

  `queries.post_with_comments(post_id: post_id))`
  
And persistance object for DB writes.

  `persistance.add(post)`
  `persistance.add(comments)`
  `persistance.persist`

## Use case example

```ruby
require "./app/domain/game"
require "./app/cases/cases"

class GameCreate
  def self.call(*args)
    new(*args).call
  end

  def initialize(queries:, persistance:, authorize:, current_user:, group_db_id:, attributes:)
    @persistance = persistance
    @queries = queries
    @current_user = current_user
    @group_db_id = group_db_id
    @attributes = attributes
    @authorize = authorize
  end

  def call
    @errors = @current_user.ban_errors(self)
    if @errors.empty?
      @errors = @authorize.game_create_errors(@current_user)
      if @errors.empty?
        group = @queries.group_with_owner_where_group_id(group_id: @group_db_id).group
        @errors = group.can_add_game_errors(@current_user)
        if @errors.empty?
          @game = Game.build
          @game.attributes.set(@attributes)
          @game.a.judge.associate(@current_user.a.judged_games).state.set_loaded
          @game.a.group.associate(group.a.games).state.set_loaded
          @errors = @game.validate_create_errors
          if @errors.empty?
            @persistance.add(@current_user, @game, group)
            @persistance.persist
          end
        end
      end
    end
    Struct
      .new(:case_name,   :type, :current_user, :persistance, :game, :page,          :success?,      :errors)
      .new(:game_create, type,  @current_user, @persistance, @game, @resolved_page, @errors.empty?, @errors).tap do |result|
      Cases.case_ran(result)
    end
  end

  def type
    :write
  end
end                
```

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'rbrt', git: 'https://github.com/hauska7/rbrt'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

And then copy file rbrt/lib/rbrt_setup.rb.move_to_project_main_directory to rbrt_setup.rb in your project main directory it needs to be required when running rbrt. For example when running rbrt from rspec without loading eg Rails it should be required in spec helper and in case you run rbrt in Rails application rbrt_setup.rb should be required in initializers.

   $ cp \`bundle show rbrt\`\lib\rbrt_setup.rb.move_to_project_main_directory rbrt_setup.rb
